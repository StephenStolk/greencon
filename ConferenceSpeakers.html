                    <!-- Speaker details here -->
                    Dr. Lee Yong Hong received a First-Class B.Sc. (Hons) in
                    Physics in 2012, followed by an M.Eng.Sc. in 2016 and a
                    Ph.D. in Engineering in 2019, all from Universiti Tunku
                    Abdul Rahman (UTAR). After joining UTAR as an Assistant
                    Professor, Dr. Lee continued his research in RFID antenna
                    design for a wide range of applications, earning recognition
                    through publications in esteemed journals such as IEEE
                    Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, as well as leading
                    conference proceedings. A notable achievement was the
                    development of an embedded tag antenna, which, despite its
                    compact size (5 × 3 × 2 mm³), achieved a high realized gain
                    of approximately −5 dBi when fully embedded in metal. To the
                    best of his knowledge, this represented the highest
                    gain-to-size ratio among similar tag antennas at the time, a
                    breakthrough that was recognized with an international
                    patent granted in Taiwan in February 2022.

                    Chi-Wen Lung, Ph.D., is currently a Professor and Chair in
                    the Department of Creative Product Design and an affiliate
                    of the Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering
                    at Asia University, Taiwan. In 2008, Dr. Lung obtained his
                    Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from National Yang-Ming
                    University, Taiwan. He completed his Postdoctoral training
                    at the Information Technology Research Center of Sports and
                    Health, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy
                    of Sciences, Hefei, China. He developed advanced
                    rehabilitation research instruments there. In 1995 and 1997,
                    he earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in Industrial Design from
                    Dayeh University and Tatung University, Taiwan. Dr. Lung was
                    a Supervisor in the Job Accommodation Office, Bureau of
                    Labor Affairs, Taipei City Government, Taipei, Taiwan. He is
                    a member of the Taiwanese Society of Biomechanics.
                    Additionally, he has six years of practical experience in
                    medical product design for research and development in the
                    industry. His full-time teaching experience at a university
                    exceeds 14 years. It is interesting to note that Dr. Lung's
                    research examines the distribution of pressure between
                    humans and orthoses, and how it affects soft tissue injury.
                    His approach can be used to improve the design of sports
                    shoes and wheelchair cushions. As well as that, he is
                    interested in the application of human-machine interfaces to
                    sports biomedical devices. According to his publication, 75
                    articles will be indexed in SCOUPUS until 2024. They include
                    41 SCI articles (24 of them are first or corresponding
                    authors). There are nine articles with the corresponding
                    author in the field of artificial intelligence. Based on the
                    AD Scientific Index, he ranks 4,169th in Taiwan (615,000th
                    in the world and 31st among Asian University). The Frontiers
                    Research Network - Loop ranks him in the top 5%. Dr. Chi-Wen
                    Lung has international experience in biomedical,
                    electromechanical, biomechanical, medical imaging, and
                    artificial intelligence.
